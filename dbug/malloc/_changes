I made the following changes to the malloc package as found in
comp.sources.unix:

	1. created this file _changes.
	2. moved README to _readme (facilitates transfer to DOS and back to
	   unix)
	3. renamed testmalloc.c, malloc_chk.c, and malloc_chn.c to testmlc.c,
	   mlc_chk.c, and mlc_chn.c respectively.  Again DOS has trouble with
	   long basenames in filenames.
