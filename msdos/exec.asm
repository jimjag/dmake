; DESCRIPTION
;      This code is a model independent version of DOS exec that will swap
;      the calling process out to secondary storage prior to running the
;      child.  The prototype for calling the exec function is below.
;
;      exec( int swap, char far *program, char far *cmdtail,
;	     int environment_seg, char far *tmpfilename );
;
;
;      To assemble this file issue the command:
;
;         tasm /mx /t /dmmodel exec.asm
;
;      where 'model' is one of {small, compact, medium, large}, you may
;      also use MASM 5.1 to assemble this file, in this case simply replace
;      'tasm' with 'masm' in the above command line.

; Special 21h (DOS call) handler to tee stdout/stderr writes to the -C file.
; Ignore 21h calls that aren't writes to 1 or 2; i.e., pass them to DOS handler.
; If write call was from this process, it's pretty simple to duplicate it
; to the -C file.  If it's from another process, we try to write to its
; inherited handle.  Worst case is where the handle wasn't inherited: someone
; closed it.  In that instance we have to switch to dmake's PSP to do the
; duplicate write.

; Subprocesses do not get their stdout/stderr teed to the -C file if
; their stdout/stderr no longer points to the file/device that dmake's
; stdout points to.  This is tested by looking at the process's job
; file table, which is a table that maps process handles to DOS system file
; table numbers.  (The far pointer to the JFT is at the PSP offset 34h.)
; The JFT is also queried to see if the -C file was inherited.

; O_BINARY, O_TEXT problems are ignored here.  These are fudged by the
; C library before it calls DOS; since we're working below that level
; we don't have to worry about it.

;	6. setup arguments for exec call
;	7. exec the program, save result code on return.
;       8. restore previous ctrl-brk and crit-error handler.
;       9. restore previous process stack, and segment registers.
