This is DMAKE version 4.12.2.

For information on how to use DMAKE, see man\dmake.nc.

The original sources of DMAKE were available from:

    http://dmake.wticorp.com

but this site has not been reachable for some time.  The sources were later
adopted by the Sun OpenOffice.org team and development was continued in their
'tools' project.  With the move of OpenOffice.org to the Apache Software
Foundation, all development on DMAKE has been abandoned.  The home page of the
OpenOffice.org 'tools' project is:

    http://tools.openoffice.org/

and details on the OpenOffice.org version of DMAKE can be found at:

    http://tools.openoffice.org/dmake/

As noted there, the DMAKE sources can still be found in the Apache-Extras site,
and can be downloaded from the stand-alone DMAKE repository at:

    http://svn.codespot.com/a/apache-extras.org/dmake/trunk/  

You can download the latest 'stable' source tarball from:

    http://code.google.com/a/apache-extras.org/p/dmake/downloads/list

This version of DMAKE is compiled from dmake-4.12.2.tar.bz2 taken from the above
downloads address, which actually linked to:

    http://dmake.apache-extras.org.codespot.com/files/dmake-4.12.2.tar.bz2

Enjoy!
