-- SYNOPSIS
--      Routines to change unix file names to mac file names
--
-- DESCRIPTION
--  Dmake sometimes assumes that files have '/' as a directory parameter in some makefiles.
--  This works, even on DOS, but not on the Mac.  In fact, on the Mac, you can't even do a
--  a simple switch of ':' for '/' because all other the Mac has decided to reverse the use
--  of a first-character directory delimiter to mean a relative path rather than absolute path.
--  (i.e., ':test:b' means directory test is relative to the current directory, rather than
--  a top-level directory.  Thus, this file attempts to do the directory conversion behind
--  the back of the rest of the program.
