 *        for entries that have matching hash_key values.  This elliminates
 *        99.9999% of all extraneous string compare operations when searching
 *        a hash table chain for matching entries.  */

	 * bit of ht_flag indicates the variable value will be set, and the
	 * type of the value that will be set.
	 *
	 * The struct below contains a mask for bit variables, and a
	 * pointer to the global STATIC location for that variable.
	 * String and char variables point to the same place as ht_value
	 * and must be updated when ht_value changes, bit variables must
	 * have their value recomputed. See Def_macro code for more
	 * details.
	 *
	 * NOTE:  Macro variables and Targets are always distinct.  Thus
	 * the value union contains pointers back at cells that own
	 * a particular name entry.  A conflict in this can never
	 * arise, ie pointers at cells will never be used as
	 * values for a macro variable, since the cell and macro
	 * name spaces are completely distinct. */
