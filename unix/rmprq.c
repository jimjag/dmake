-- SYNOPSIS
--      Remove prerequisites code.
-- 
-- DESCRIPTION
--	This code is different for DOS and for UNIX and parallel make
--	architectures since the parallel case requires the rm's to be
--	run in parallel, whereas DOS guarantees to run them sequentially.

Remove_prq( tcp )/*
===================
   Removable targets (ie. an inferred intermediate node) are removed
   by this function by running Make() on the special target .REMOVE
   (pointed to by tcp).
   As this function can be called from within another Make() (for example
   like this:
     Make()->Exec_commands()->Do_cmnd()->runargv()->..->_finished_child()
     ->Update_time_stamp()->Remove_prq() )
   it is necessary to store and restore the dynamic macros when Make()
   is finished.

   FIXME: Another potential problem is that while building .REMOVE another
   previously started target finishes and from _finished_child() calls
   Remove_prq() again. This will delete the dynamic macros and possibly
   clear/reset the prerequisites of the previous .REMOVE target.
