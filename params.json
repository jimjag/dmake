{"name":"Telaen","tagline":"Telaen is a webmail interface written in PHP. It does not require any database and is compatible with POP3 or IMAP so it runs under any Server supporting PHP with Sendmail or QMAIL. Additional skins and languages can be easily integrated.","body":"# Telaen - A full-featured yet simple web-based e-mail client written in PHP\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nTelaen is a web-based e-mail client written in PHP. What is particularly\r\nnice about Telaen is that it is fast, lean and simple, but also extremely\r\npowerful. It does not require much more than a \"standard\" PHP\r\ninstallation, nor does it require a database. It supports multiple\r\nfolders, POP3 and IMAP, is SPAM aware and incorporates a WYSIWYG editor\r\nfor Email composition. It supports multiple languages as well as\r\nmultiple themes (or \"skins\").\r\n\r\nTelaen 1.3.x is compatible with PHP4 and PHP5. Starting with Telaen\r\n2.x, support for PHP4 will be dropped.\r\n\r\nTelaen was originally based on Uebimiau.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you read the other documents in the docs/ subdirectory,\r\nespecially the CHANGELOG.txt and INSTALL.txt files.\r\n\r\n## Why you might need it\r\n\r\nOther PHP-based webmails require database support as well as a long\r\nlaundry-list of other PHP libs and extensions; not Telaen. If\r\nyou need an expandable, powerful yet simple webmail system,\r\nTelaen will likely fit the bill.\r\n\r\nAnd, if you are stuck running ancient Uebimiau, you should\r\nreally move to Telaen asap.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nTelaen is free software distributed under GPLv2 terms; see www.gnu.org for\r\nmore informations.

The below external dependencies are bundled for convenience:\r\n\r\n- Smarty\r\n- TinyMCE\r\n- PHPMailer\r\n- iCalCreator\r\n\r\nTelaen is designed to work with both the bundled as well as the system-provided\r\nversions of these tools.\r\n\r\nNo database is required.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease submit bug reports, suggestions and pull requests to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/jimjag/telaen/issues).\r\n\r\nWe're particularly interested in fixing edge-cases, expanding test coverage and dropping support for PHP4, PHP5.1\r\nand PHP5.2.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nSee CHANGELOG.md in ./docs/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
